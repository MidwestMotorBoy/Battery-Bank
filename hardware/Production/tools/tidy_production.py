"""Drawing tidy for the production schematic (re-runnable; run right after make_production.py).

  * deletes leftovers of the link merges: a wire whose two ends carry only same-name labels, or only power
    symbols of the same net;
  * turns the gauge pogo pads to face away from their labels and shows the pack pad values;
  * deletes headings of removed blocks, renames the rest, rewrites the sheet notes, root index and revision log;
  * renames the sheets 'Sleep Current and 3V3' -> '3V3 Rail' and 'MCU and Sensors' -> 'MCU'.
